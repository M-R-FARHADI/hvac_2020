    "In a heating/humidifying system moist air first flows through a heating coil and then through an air washer. The air enters the system  at  55$^\\circ$F  dry-bulb  temperature  and  40% humidity. The air exits the system at 90$^\\circ$F dry-bulb temperature and  65$^\\circ$F  thermodynamic  wet-bulb  temperature.  The  flow  rate through the system is 2200 lbma/hr and the process occurs at a pressure of 29.921 in Hg. Determine:\n",
